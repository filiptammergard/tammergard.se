I first started blogging in 2018. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks or dependencies.

In 2019, I wanted to reuse UI components, so I rewrote my blog in React.

In 2020, I wanted to use MDX, so I rewrote my blog in Gatsby. I built my own internationalization solution. It worked, but had a few bugs that I didn't have the energy to prioritize properly.

In 2021, I wanted to learn Next.js, so I rewrote my blog in...Next.js.

Later in 2021, I wanted to ship less JavaScript, so I rewrote my blog it in Astro.

In 2022, I wanted this madness to end.

So I rewrote my blog in Docusaurus.

I did.

But I think it might be a good idea. These five years, I have been spending 95% of the time building the blog platform and 5% writing the blog posts. And I have realized I don't want to spend time building a blog platform. I want to write blog posts.

Sure, building my custom internationalization solution was fun. But honestly, it was not worth it. That time would have been better spent writing blog posts...which is what I actually want to do.

With Docusaurus, I won't build my own blogging platform. It's already there. Everything works. I can focus on writing blog posts. I can breathe!

I hope from the bottom from my heart that I won't rewrite my blog again in many years. But looking at my track record, it will probably happen...in a few weeks?
