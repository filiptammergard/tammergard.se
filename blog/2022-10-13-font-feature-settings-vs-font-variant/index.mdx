We recently did some tweaks to the font we use at work. For one thing, we changed the appearance of 0 (number zero) to include a slash (like `0`), to make it easier to differentiate from capital letter O. I learned something new during the proccess that I'd like to share!

## Slashed zeros

There are two main ways to configure slashed zeros.

1. `font-feature-settings: "zero" 1;`
2. `font-variant: slashed-zero;`

<!-- truncate -->

:::note

A prerequisite for this to work is that the font you are using supports slashed zeros.

### font-feature-settings

The `font-feature-settings` property is a bit strange. It accepts one or more font feature tags consisting of 4 ASCII characters. If a tag is followed by `1` or `on`, that font feature is enabled, and if followed by `0` or `off`, it's disabled. As mentioned, here's how to enable slashed zeros:

```css
font-feature-settings: "zero" 1;
```

:::note

`font-feature-settings: "zero";` works as well, because if no value is provided, it defaults to 1,

In the case of slashed zeros, the tag "zero" is clear. But in other cases, it's pretty much gibberish. As an example, can you figure out what font features this enables?

```css
font-feature-settings: "c2sc", "smcp";
```

Me neither!

When I dove into some [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings#syntax), I noticed that `font-variant` should be preferred over `font-feature-settings` whenever possible. Apparently, `font-feature-settings` is mostly a kind of backup property for when `font-variant` can't accomplish the same thing. So let's explore `font-variant` instead!

## font-variant

`font-variant` was a lot easier to understand compared to `font-feature-settings`. No 4 ASCII characters hereâ€”but rather describing property values! Look at this beauty:

```css
font-variant: slashed-zero;
```

Super clear!

Turns out, `font-variant` is actually a shorthand for these properties:

- `font-variant-alternates`
- `font-variant-caps`
- `font-variant-east-asian`
- `font-variant-ligatures`
- `font-variant-numeric`

These properties can be used to target subsets of glyphs. As an example, `font-variant-caps` only targets capital letters.

In the case of slashed zeros, it will naturally only take effect on numbers. Therefore, it makes sense to use `font-variant-numeric` that only targets numbers.

```css
font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;
```

## Conclusion

- Enabling and disabling font features can be done in many ways.
- Prefer `font-variant` over `font-feature-settings`. Consider `font-feature-settings` to be a backup for when `font-variant` can't do the same thing.
- Prefer being specific with what subsets of glyphs should be targeted when applicable instead of using the `font-variant` shorthand. For example, `font-variant-numeric` only targets numbers.
