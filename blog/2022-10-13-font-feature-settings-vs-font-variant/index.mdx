We recently did some font feature tweaks at work. For one thing, we changed the appearance of 0 (number zero) to include a slash (like `0`), to make it easier to differentiate from capital letter O. I learned a few things in the process that I'd like to share!

## Slashed zeros

There are two main ways to configure slashed zeros.

1. `font-feature-settings: "zero" 1;`
2. `font-variant: slashed-zero;`

<!-- truncate -->

:::note

A prerequisite for this to work is that the font you are using supports slashed zeros.

## font-feature-settings

The `font-feature-settings` property is a bit strange. It accepts one or more font feature tags consisting of 4 ASCII characters. If a tag is followed by `1` or `on`, that font feature is enabled, and if followed by `0` or `off`, it's disabled. As mentioned, here's how to enable slashed zeros:

```css
font-feature-settings: "zero" 1;
```

:::note

`font-feature-settings: "zero";` works as well—if no value is provided, it defaults to 1.

:::

In the case of slashed zeros, the tag "zero" is clear. But in other cases, it's pretty much gibberish. As an example, can you figure out what font features this enables?

```css
font-feature-settings: "c2sc", "smcp";
```

Me neither!

The `font-feature-settings` property is also error-prone, since [it sets every font feature that you don't explicitly list to it's default value](https://pixelambacht.nl/2022/boiled-down-fixing-variable-font-inheritance/).

Most font features can also be set with the `font-variant` property, which does not have the side effect of unsetting unlisted font features. For this reason, [it's generally recommended to use `font-variant` instead of `font-feature-settings` whenever possible](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/fonts#opentype-features).

So let's explore `font-variant` instead!

## font-variant

The `font-variant` property is a lot easier to understand compared to `font-feature-settings`. No 4 ASCII characters here—but rather describing property values! Look at this beauty:

```css
font-variant: slashed-zero;
```

Super clear!

`font-variant` is actually a shorthand for these properties:

- `font-variant-alternates`
- `font-variant-caps`
- `font-variant-east-asian`
- `font-variant-ligatures`
- `font-variant-numeric`

These longhand properties can be used to target subsets of glyphs. As an example, `font-variant-caps` only targets capital letters.

In the case of slashed zeros, it will naturally only take effect on numbers. Therefore, it makes sense to use `font-variant-numeric` that only targets numbers.

```css
font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;
```

## Conclusion

- Enabling font features can be done in many ways.
- Prefer `font-variant` over `font-feature-settings`. Consider `font-feature-settings` to be a backup for when `font-variant` can't do the same thing.
- Prefer being specific with what subsets of glyphs should be targeted instead of using the `font-variant` shorthand. For example, `font-variant-numeric` only targets numbers.
