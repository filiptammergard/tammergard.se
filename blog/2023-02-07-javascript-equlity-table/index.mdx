import { Table } from "./Table"

I recently stumbled upon the [JavaScript equality table](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/). I'm always impressed by nice ways of visualizing such concepts. And I immediately thought it would be a fun thing to build myself!

Choose between double equals and triple equals to see how that affects the equality table.

<Table />
