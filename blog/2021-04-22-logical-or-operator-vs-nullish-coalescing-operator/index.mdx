import { CompareOperators } from "./CompareOperators";

`||` and `??` are similar, but there's some _very_ important nuance. Take a look at this example:

```js
const a = "" || "default value";
// > "default value"

const b = "" ?? "default value";
// > ""
```

Let me explain.

## Logical OR operator

Let's pretend you are the _logical OR operator_ (`||`). You see one value to the
left and one value to the right. You start looking at that value to the left. If that value is
_truthy_, that's the value you pick. If the left value is _falsy_, you pick the other value.

To understand your task, you have to know what truthy and falsy values are.

### Truthy and Falsy values

Here are all falsy values in JavaScript:

- number `0`
- bigint `0n`
- keyword `null`
- keyword `undefined`
- boolean `false`
- number `NaN`
- empty string `""`, `''`, or ` `` `

All other values are truthy.

## Nullish coalescing operator

Now let's pretend you are the _nullish coalescing operator_ (`??`). Again, you see one
value to the left and one value, and you start looking at the value to the left. This time, if the left value is _nullish_, you pick the other value. If the left value is not nullish, that's the value you pick.

This assignment requires knowledge about nullish values.

### Nullish values

Here are all nullish values in JavaScript:

- keyword `null`
- keyword `undefined`

:::note

As you can see, all nullish values are falsy, but not all falsy values are nullish.

## Try it out!

A good way to solidify knowledge about this difference is to experiment with it. In the code
below, there is a `leftValue` and a `rightValue` variable. You can select what value you want `leftValue` to take. Then you'll see what the two operators will output.

<CompareOperators />

Now you know when to use `||` and when to use `??`! ðŸŽ‰

## Conclusion

- Be intentional when you choose between `||` and `??`â€”using the wrong operator can cause bugs.
- Use `??` when you only want to specify a fallback for nullish values (`null` and `undefined`).
- Use `||` when you want to specify a fallback for all falsy values.
