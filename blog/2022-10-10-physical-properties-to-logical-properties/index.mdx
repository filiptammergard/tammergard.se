I have been making the switch over from physical to logical properties over the past months. Logical properties require a different mental model compared to physical properties. `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` in the physical declration world are simple to reason about, since you can see the direction in your head immediately. `top` is `top` and `left` is `left`â€”simple as that. However, this is also where physical properties become problematic.

## The problem with physical properties

Let's say we want to display a simple paragraph with a border and some margin to the left:

```html
<p>Hello!</p>
```

```css
p {
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin-left: 2rem;
}
```

<p style={{ border: "1px solid red", marginLeft: "2rem" }}>Hello!</p>

Cool!

But what happens if this is done in a language with a right-to-left text direction? Let's try updating the text direction while keeping the same CSS:

```html
<p dir="rtl">Hello!</p>
```

<p dir="rtl" style={{ border: "1px solid red", marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
  Hello!
</p>

That's not really what we want...

We want the margin to update with the change of text direction. But left is always left, independent on the direction of the text.

## Enter logical properties

Let's try using logical properties instead!

```html
<p>Hello!</p>
```

```css
p {
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin-inline-start: 2rem;
}
```

<p style={{ border: "1px solid red", marginInlineStart: "2rem" }}>Hello!</p>

Let's try to change the text direction again while keeping the same CSS.

```html
<p dir="rtl">Hello!</p>
```

<p dir="rtl" style={{ border: "1px solid red", marginInlineStart: "2rem" }}>
  Hello!
</p>

That's what we want!

As mentioned, logical properties require a different mental model compared to physical properties. In the long run, it's useful to start thinking in block flow and inline flow instead of in physical directions. During a transition, however, when you most likely still think in physical properties, it can be useful to be able to map the physical properties to the corresponding logical properties.

:::note

The physical directions of logical properties change depending on writing mode and text direction. Actually, that's the point. But it also means the writing mode and text direction environment needs to be specified to enable mapping physical properties to logical.

from physical properties in the English (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) world to logical properties. That's what the rest of this post handles!

## Converting to logical properties

In the following conversion tables, the baseline writing mode and text direction is English (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

### Padding

Here's how physical padding properties translate to logical:

| Physical property | Logical property       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| `padding-top`     | `padding-block-start`  |
| `padding-right`   | `padding-inline-end`   |
| `padding-bottom`  | `padding-block-end`    |
| `padding-right`   | `padding-inline-start` |

#### Shorthands

The `padding` property is a shorthand that enables setting paddings in multiple directions in one declaration. `padding: 1rem;` sets `1rem` padding in all four directions. Since it sets the same padding in all direction, there's no need to convert to logical.

Take a look at this padding declaration:

```css
p {
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}
```

That's a shorthand for this:

```css
p {
  padding-top: 1rem;
  padding-bottom: 1rem;
  padding-left: 2rem;
  padding-right: 2rem;
}
```

In logical property land, this is the equivalent:

```css
p {
  padding-block: 1rem;
  padding-inline: 2rem;
}
```

:::info

In the physical property world, setting top and bottom padding is commonly done with `padding: 1rem 0;`. However, a side effect of using the shorthand is that `padding-left` and `padding-right` is set to 0. Therefore, converting to the logical `padding-block: 1rem`, is not truly equivalent, as there is no side effect in this case.

I think setting default values just to be able to use the shorthands should be avoided, which is another reason why `padding-block` and `padding-inline` are great replacements for the `padding` shorthand.

### Margin

Logical margin properties work in the exact same way as logical padding properties. Here's the translation table:

| Physical property | Logical property      |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `margin-top`      | `margin-block-start`  |
| `margin-right`    | `margin-inline-end`   |
| `margin-bottom`   | `margin-block-end`    |
| `margin-right`    | `margin-inline-start` |

These are the only margin properties that have a one-to-one mapping between physical and logical. But there's more!

### Borders

Converting border radii to logical required me to be careful about the order of properties. The format is `border-{block-direction}-{inline-direction}-radius`.

| Physical property            | Logical property            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `border-top`                 | `border-block-start`        |
| `border-right`               | `border-inline-end`         |
| `border-bottom`              | `border-block-end`          |
| `border-left`                | `border-inline-start`       |
| `border-top-left-radius`     | `border-start-start-radius` |
| `border-top-right-radius`    | `border-start-end-radius`   |
| `border-bottom-right-radius` | `border-end-end-radius`     |
| `border-bottom-left-radius`  | `border-end-start-radius`   |

`border-top-{color|style|width}` can also be converted to `border-block-start-{color|style|width}`, exactly as you would image.

### Sizing

Here's the conversion table for sizing properties.

| Physical property | Logical property  |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `height`          | `block-size`      |
| `min-height`      | `min-block-size`  |
| `max-height`      | `max-block-size`  |
| `width`           | `inline-size`     |
| `min-width`       | `min-inline-size` |
| `max-width`       | `max-inline-size` |

### Alignment

As you might have noticed, physical directions like `left` and `right` don't exist at all in logical property land. That's not only true for property names, but also for values. `left` can mostly be translated to `start` and `right` to `end`.

| Physical declaration      | Logical declaration       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `text-align: left;`       | `text-align: start;`      |
| `text-align: right;`      | `text-align: end;`        |
| `justify-content: left;`  | `justify-content: start;` |
| `justify-content: right;` | `justify-content: end;`   |

:::info

The `justify-content` property accepts `start` and `end` as values, but also `flex-start` and `flex-end`. So what's the difference? The main difference is browser support. `flex-{start|end}` has better support, but `start|end` will replace the flex values eventually.

### Positioning

For positioning, we're going to start working a lot with `inset` in different shape and forms.

| Physical property | Logical property     |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `top`             | `inset-block-start`  |
| `right`           | `inset-inline-end`   |
| `bottom`          | `inset-block-end`    |
| `left`            | `inset-inline-start` |

#### Shorthands

There are some useful shorthands as well!

| Physical declaration                                         | Logical declaration |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `top: 0`;<br />`bottom: 0;`                                  | `inset-block: 0;`   |
| `left: 0;`<br />`right: 0;`                                  | `inset-inline: 0;`  |
| `top: 0;`<br />`right: 0;`<br />`bottom: 0;`<br />`left: 0;` | `inset: 0;`         |
