Languages use various writing modes. Some use a left-to-right top-to-bottom writing mode (e.g. English). Others use right-to-left top-to-bottom (e.g. Arabic). There are even languages that use a vertical or bidirectional writing mode. CSS has a set of properties and features to support these different writing modes. The CSS specification [CSS Writing Modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/) is an interesting readâ€”but it's quite technical.
